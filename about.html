<div class="about-me">
    <p>I’m Daniela Oliveira, a designer interested in UX/UI and digital design based in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
    <p>Been working in advertising & social media strategy for the past two years coming  up with creative concepts to help brands tell stories. </p>
    <p>As a 360° project kind of professional, I’ve been working with video, photography, graphic and motion design since 2015. </p>
    <p>I’m also very curious about programming and web development. Spent a year learning Python and been trying to understand how technology works on the back-end.</p>

        <strong>Three facts about me!</strong>
        <p>I eat too much, rollerskate and shred skateparks for more time than my schedule can handle & I’m always down to travel around (but only if I can bring my skates with me).</p>
